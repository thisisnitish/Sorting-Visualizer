# Sorting Visualizer

## under-development

A Web App built using ReactJS. It is used to visualize the sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Bubble Sort etc.
The purpose of creating this project was to visualize all the classic sorting algorithms. Hope you will enjoy while playing
with this tool.

# Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is a method for reorganizing a large number of items into a specific order, such as alphabetical, highest-to-lowest value or shortest-to-longest distance. Sorting algorithms take lists of items as input data, perform specific operations on those lists and deliver ordered arrays as output. 

## Classic Sorting Algorithms

* ### Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

## Installation

If you want to run this locally, Fork this repository, Clone it and install the dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/Sorting-Visualizer.git
cd Sorting-Visualizer
npm install
```
And, you are Good to Go!!!

This Project was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/clementmihailescu/">Cl√©ment Mihailescu's</a> Sorting Visualizer Tutorial Video that I watched on his YouTube Channel.
